## üßë‚Äçüíª Short Personal Introduction (for RSSchool Stage 0)

I'm a passionate and self-motivated person who is actively learning software development with a focus on fullstack web technologies. My main areas of interest are Angular for frontend and NestJS for backend development. I'm currently deepening my knowledge in JavaScript, TypeScript, REST APIs, databases, and modern frameworks to become a well-rounded developer.

My goal is to become a skilled fullstack developer capable of building scalable and efficient web applications from scratch. I aim to gain hands-on experience working in real projects, collaborating with other developers, and constantly improving my technical and soft skills.

### My priorities:

- Mastering core concepts of both frontend and backend development.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and testable code.
- Learning how to read documentation effectively and solve complex problems.
- Participating in team projects and learning how to work in a professional environment.

### My strengths:

- Strong desire to learn and improve every day.
- Disciplined and responsible.
- Analytical thinking and problem-solving mindset.
- Patient and persistent when facing challenges.
- Comfortable with self-study and online learning platforms.

Although I don't have official work experience in IT yet, I've been consistently practicing programming through personal projects, coding exercises, and online courses. I'm confident that my dedication, enthusiasm, and ability to learn quickly will help me grow into a valuable member of any development team in the future.
